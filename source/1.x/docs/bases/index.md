*Version 1.x*

For programmer's convenience `dcl` provides following general base "classes":

* [Mixer](./bases/mixer) - *"class", which constructor mixes an object
(its only argument) in its instance*
* [Replacer](./bases/replacer) - *"class", which constructor mixes an object
(its only argument) in its instance by replacing existing properties;
all non-existing properties will be ignored*
