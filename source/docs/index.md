`dcl` is a micro library written in JavaScript for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and browsers. It implements OOP with mixins + AOP at both "class" and object level.

Currently it exists in two versions:

* [2.x](/2.x/docs) - *targets ES5 browsers with support for property descriptors, and getters/setters.*
* [1.x](/1.x/docs) - *targets legacy browsers (goes back at least to IE8).*

Both versions work fine on [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
