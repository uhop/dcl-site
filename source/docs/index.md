`dcl` is a micro library written in JavaScript for [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
and modern browsers that implements OOP with mixins + AOP at both "class" and
object level.

Currently it exists in two versions:

* [2.x](./2.x/docs) - *targets ES5 browsers with support for property descriptors, and getters/setters.*
* [1.x](./1.x/docs) - *targets legacy browsers (goes back at least to IE8).*

Both versions work fine on [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

`dcl` comes with a small library of useful advices, mixins, and base classes.
Additionally the documentation covers a wide range of advanced topics:

* [Documentation for 2.x](./2.x/docs)
* [Documentation for 1.x](./1.x/docs)
