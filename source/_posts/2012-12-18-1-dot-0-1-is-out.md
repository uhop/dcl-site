1.0.1 is a minor update. This version has following changes:

* Added [getInherited()](/1.x/docs/inherited_js/getinherited) as an alias for
  [inherited.get()](/1.x/docs/inherited_js/get) to simplify its use. Now
  there is no need to use `call()` or `apply()` to specify its instance.
* Added tests for `dcl` exceptions.
* Added tests for canned advices and mixins.
* Changed export names for `<script>` inclusion.
* Error messages are better formatted.
* Minor clean up, better comments, documentation updates.

So far `dcl` has proved to be fairly stable, no major bugs were found.
Almost all changes in 1.0.1 are backward-compatible, and upgrading to it
should be transparent.

The only non-compatible change is export names with `<script>` tags,
which are not recommended anyway -- when in browser please use an AMD
loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/).
