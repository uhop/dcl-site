This is a major update, which includes support for legacy browsers (IE < 9). It doesn't affect existing users, because it doesn't change the API or its semantics, but provides an option for legacy applications. It is considered "major" because it changes some internal plumbing.

[legacy.js](/docs/legacy_js) documentation contains all necessary background information for the change, and recommendations on how to use it in real projects.

Changes:

* Added metadata for an extended Dojo release.
* Internal code is better formatted, better documented, variables are renamed to use more suggestive names.
* Added [legacy.js](/docs/legacy_js) module, which is a substitute for [mini.js](/docs/mini_js) in legacy environments.
