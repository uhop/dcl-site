This is a technical release, which doesn't change the functionality in any way. You can safely skip it.

The version bump was required in order to add `dcl` to [bower](http://bower.io/) --- a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management. If you use Bower to manage your project dependencies, you can install `dcl` like this:

{% codeblock %}
bower install dcl
{% endcodeblock %}
