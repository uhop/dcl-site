New update was pushed out. Changes:

* Bugfix: in some cases when using a native constructor created without `dcl`
  it was not called when creating an object. This bug is fixed and relevant
  tests were added.
* All tests are consolidated using [heya-unit](https://github.com/heya/unit).
  No more manual tests.
* Added an automated testing in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) environment.
* Increased test coverage.

This update is about maintenance. It doesn't introduce new features. Given that
the fixed bug is quite exotic, this update can be skipped unless a code contains
a mix of `dcl` and non-`dcl` bases and mixins in the same constructor functions.
