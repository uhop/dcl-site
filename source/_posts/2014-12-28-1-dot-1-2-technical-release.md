1.1.2 is an intermediate technical release. While the interface and the functionality were not affected,
internals were refactored, and updated to improve their readability and maintainability.

This update can be safely skipped by most users, yet I advise to test it against your codebase,
because it will serve as a foundation for the upcoming major version.
