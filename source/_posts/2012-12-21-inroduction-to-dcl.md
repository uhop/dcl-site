[David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/about-david-walsh) has asked me
to do a guest blog post. When I offered him to write about `dcl`,
he agreed, and here we go:
[Introduction to dcl](http://davidwalsh.name/intro-dcl).

If you don't read [David's blog](http://davidwalsh.name/) regularly,
and you are serious about web applications, you are missing out.
He frequently publishes very interesting articles on JavaScript, CSS,
new development in browsers, and so on. Check out his tutorials,
demos, and in-depth articles. Get yourself in the know.
