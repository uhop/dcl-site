If you have questions on `dcl` check out following resources:

* [Documentation](/docs) - *the first stop for information on `dcl`, explanations,
  and examples.*
* [Source code](https://github.com/uhop/dcl) - *use the source, Luke!*
* [dcl.js forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dcljs) - *dedicated mailing list,
  if you prefer to communicate by email use
  [dcljs@googlegroups.com](mailto:dcljs@googlegroups.com)*
* [@dcl_js](http://twitter.com/dcl_js) - *follow on Twitter to get announcements

If you found a bug, or a documentation error, or any other problem:

* [Bug tracker on github](https://github.com/uhop/dcl/issues) - *just open a ticket*.
  * Bugs with small test cases will be fast-tracked.
  * If you have a solution, do not hesitate to do a pull request, which should include
    a fix and its test.

And you can always write to me: eugene@dcljs.org.
