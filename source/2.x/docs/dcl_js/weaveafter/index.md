*Version 2.x*

It is a weaver object, which defines how to chain using `after` method (the first one is called first). It is used by [dcl.chainAfter()](/2.x/docs/dcl_js/chainafter/), and by `after` advices.

See [dcl.chainWith()](/2.x/docs/dcl_js/chainwith/) for more information on weaver objects.

This object is not for direct use by end users. It is exposed solely to extend `dcl`.
