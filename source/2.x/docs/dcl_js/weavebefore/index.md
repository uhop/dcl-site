*Version 2.x*

It is a weaver object, which defines how to chain using `before` method (the last one is called first). It is used by [dcl.chainBefore()](/2.x/docs/dcl_js/chainbefore/), and by `before` advices.

See [dcl.chainWith()](/2.x/docs/dcl_js/chainwith/) for more information on weaver objects.

This object is not for direct use by end users. It is exposed solely to extend `dcl`.
