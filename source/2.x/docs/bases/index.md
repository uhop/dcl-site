*Version 2.x*

For programmer's convenience `dcl` provides following general base "classes":

* [Mixer](/2.x/docs/bases/mixer/) - *"class", which constructor mixes an object (its only argument) in its instance*
* [Replacer](/2.x/docs/bases/replacer/) - *"class", which constructor mixes an object (its only argument) in its instance by replacing existing properties; all non-existing properties will be ignored*
