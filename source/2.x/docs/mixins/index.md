*Version 2.x*

For programmer's convenience `dcl` provides following general mixins:

* [Destroyable](/2.x/docs/mixins/destroyable/) - *mixin, which declares a chainable method `destroy()`*
* [Cleanup](/2.x/docs/mixins/cleanup/) - *mixin, which builds on `Destroyable` and adds an API to manage a cleanup on destruction*
