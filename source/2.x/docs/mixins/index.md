*Version 2.x*

For programmer's convenience `dcl` provides following general mixins:

* [Destroyable](./mixins/destroyable) - *mixin, which declares a chainable method `destroy()`*
* [Cleanup](./mixins/cleanup) - *mixin, which builds on `Destroyable` and adds an API to manage a cleanup on destruction*
